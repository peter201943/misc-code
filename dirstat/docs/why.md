# Motivation

Have you ever struggle to maintain metadata across filesystems?

Wish there was some convenient, plaintext, cross-platform way of doing it?

Wanted some simple app for recording filesystem-native values?

Wanted some easy-to-use/obvious app for doing it?

Try DirStat!


## Extensibility

Wanted to be as extendable as Tags in YAML

Write out your types as a Schema

So list your schemas in a DirStat file as URL's

Be sure to pull-request into DirStat so others can use your schemas!
